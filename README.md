# Frontend Mentor - IP Address Tracker Solution

This is my solution to the [IP Address Tracker challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0). The project is aimed at helping me improve my skills in React, Leaflet.js for maps, and handling API requests in a real-world app.

## Overview

### The Challenge

The challenge is to build an interactive IP address tracker that allows users to:

* View their current location on the map by default.
* Search for an IP address or domain name and see its location on the map.
* View a responsive layout optimized for mobile and desktop devices.

## My Process

### Built with

* **React** – A powerful JS library to create interactive UIs.
* **Leaflet.js** – A map library used to show the IP address location on the map.
* **Axios** – For handling API requests.
* **CSS (Flexbox, Grid, Custom Properties)** – To create the layout.
* **Vite** – To bundle the project quickly.

### What I Learned

* How to integrate **Leaflet.js** with **React** to display interactive maps.
* Handling **Geolocation API** and **IP geolocation** requests to track IP addresses.
* How to use **React hooks** like `useEffect` and `useState` for managing component lifecycle and states.
* Customizing **map markers** and handling the positioning of popups in Leaflet.js.
* Improved my skills in **responsive design** to ensure a smooth experience across devices.
* How to handle **API error responses** and provide user-friendly feedback.

### Continued Development

* Further optimize the application to handle errors gracefully and improve user feedback.
* Integrate **loading spinners** or animations while fetching data from the API.
* Add more map functionality such as zoom control or satellite view.
* Focus on **state management** with libraries like Redux to better manage app states in larger projects.

### Useful Resources

* [Leaflet Documentation](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html) – Essential for handling map markers, popups, and tile layers.
* [Axios Documentation](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) – Helps in making API requests, especially for geolocation services.
* [Frontend Mentor - IP Address Tracker](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0) – The challenge itself was an excellent guide to improve my frontend skills.

### Updates:

1. **Built with** section now specifically lists React, Leaflet, Axios, and Vite.
2. **What I Learned** now includes key learnings and what I specifically tackled in the project (like API requests, custom map markers).
3. **Continued Development** gives ideas for next steps and improvements.
4. **Useful Resources** contains links to the tools and documentation that helped you build the project.

I hope this helps, and feel free to tweak it further based on your specific experience!
